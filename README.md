# CPSC 323 Project 2 

## Overview
This program involves creating a program that traces input strings over a given set of characters and symbols that end with a '$' sign. Given the CFG and the parsing table, we have to trace input strings over the set {id+*)(} ending with '$'. We also have to test with the three given input strings (1)(id+id)id$ (2) idid$ and (id*)$.

## Setup
Clone or download this repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinvqle/323hw2.git
```
Make sure you have Python downloaded on your device

## Usage
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the **CFGScaner.py** script is located.
2. Run the lexer by exexuting the following command. 
```bash
python3 CFGScaner.py
```
3. The output will be output as step, stack, input and action with all 3 strings being tested.
